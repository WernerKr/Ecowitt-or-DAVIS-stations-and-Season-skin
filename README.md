## Driver Ecowittcustom
   This driver fully supports all currently available data from Ecowitt Wi-Fi consoles and/or gateways.
   
   It supports both the Ecowitt Protocol and the Wunderground Protocol

If you also use Oliver's FOSHKplugin, and the corresponding Wi-Fi station also provides the signals, 
or the gateways always provide the signals, the Ecowitt Custom function in the Ecowitt protocol sends 
the data to the FOSHKplugin, and FOSHKplugin forwards the data to the Ecowittcustom driver for WeeWx.

This provides the functionality of the GW1000 driver with all newer data (e.g. inbuilt WS3910 CO2 sensor, LDS sensor WH54, VPD) 
that is no longer provided by the Ecowitt API (last Telnet v1.7.0).
```
Ecowitt protocol:
  - Ecowitt Gateways GW1000, GW1100, GW1200, GW2000, GW3000, WS38xx, WS39xx, WS1900, WN1980, WN1900, WH2650 
  - Ecowitt wifi consoles HP2560, HP2550, HP3500, WS39xx, WS38xx, WN1980, WN1900, WS1900
``` 
All mapping and unit assignments are done in the Ecowittcustom driver

The wview_extended database schema has been extended for Ecowitt data and is provided as wview_ecowitt schema.

Script files (add_ecowitt_data_v5.sh, add_ecowitt_allsignaldata_v5.sh, add_ecowitt_to_wview_extended_database.sh) 
are provided to extend an existing database accordingly.

The rain from the piezo sensors (WS85, WS90) is recorded as hail or hailRate!
This allows you to compare both data if a WH40 rain sensor is also present.

If you want the signal values (0-4) provided by the FOSHKplugin to be expressed as percentages, 
you can do so in the weewx.conf file in the section
```
[StdCalibrate]
[[Corrections]]
ws90_sig = ws90_sig * 25 if ws90_sig is not None else None
ws85_sig = ws85_sig * 25 if ws85_sig is not None else None
wh54_ch1_sig = wh54_ch1_sig * 25 if wh54_ch1_sig is not None else None
```
This will then be automatically taken into account in the SeasonsEcowitt skin (sensors.inc).

## Skin SeasonsEcowitt or SeasonsDavis too
Based on the new structure of the Seasons skin (sensor management in array) I have the Seasons Skin
extended accordingly so that all possible sensor data of the Ecowitt stations/devices are displayed.
There is also the option of displaying the air quality index for AQI EPA (US) or AQI EEA (EU).
It currently contains all database values from the weewx_extended database schema
and now Ecowitt database schema weewx_ecowitt and loop values of
Ecowitt (Ecowittcustom: ecowitt-client) or GW1000 driver, VantagePro, Davis Weatherlink Live, Davis AirLink
In order to get all data from the Ecowitt stations/devices, you have to use my 
Ecowittcustom driver
or GW1000 driver.
```
My array offers these possibilities:
  at current.inc example for outside temperature:
  ('outTemp', '#e85d0d', 'current', '1')
  or
  ('outTemp','#e85d0d','day','1')
  (1:value, 2:labelcolor, ''=black, 3:current or day or yesterday or aqiepa or aqieea or trend or deltatime or wx_binding?, 4:'1')
  3: = current -> default
  3: = day -> show avages of the day
  3: = yesterday -> show avages of the last day
  3: = 3:yesterday -> at 1:radiation  -> radiation.energy_integral.kilowatt_hour_per_meter_squared for yesterday and day
  3: = trend -> show additonal to value the 24hr trend or 3 hr trend (barometer)
  3: = deltatime -> for sunShineDur or rainDur or hailDur
  3: = 'wx_binding?' -> example: 'wx_binding3, WS90' Data are from the Database settings 'wx_binding3' and here additional to the label is ' WS90' added
  3: = 'daywx_bindig?' or 'trendwx_bindging?' are also allowed. example: 'daywx_binding3, Ultrasonic'
  3: = aqiepa -> computes pm2_5 Air quality Index EPA
  3: = aqieea -> computes pm2_5 Air quality Index EEA
  4: = 1 show, 4: = 0 don't show, although values are available, 4: = 3 Textinformation or Separation

at hilo.inc and statistics.inc
  observ-Array -> (1:value, 2:labelcolor, ''=black, 3:''=min&max or max or sum or wx_binding?, 4:don't show, although values are available = 0)
  ('outTemp', '#e85d0d', '', '1'),
  1: value
  2: label color, if '' = black
  3: which evaluation , '' (= empty = min and max), or sum, or only max
  3: ='wx_binding?' or 'sumwx_binding?' or 'maxwx_binding?' or 'minwx_binding?' or 'avgwx_binding?' or 'maxwx_binding?, Text' or ...
  -> example: 'wx_binding3, WS90' or 'maxwx_binding3, WS90' Data are from the Database settings 'wx_binding3' and here additional to the label is ' WS90' added
  4: show if available, if 0 never show (e.g. for indoor temperature)
  labelcolor can be general disabled -> #set $usefontcolor = 0


In addition, the skin also takes into account that the Ecowitt stations / devices use the unit "%" for the soil moisture values
  and not "cb" as specified centrally in Weewx
  In general, a label color can be used with
  #set $usefontcolor = 0
  be switched off
  The order in the array is also the display position.

#### Calculation of the sunshine duration and now too rain duration:

Which, however, was modified by me weewx/user/sunrainduration.py
and the configuration is done via the weewx.conf and this entry:
```
Code:
[RadiationDays]
    min_sunshine = 120     	# Entry of extension radiationhours.py, if is installed (= limit value)
    sunshine_coeff = 0.8   	# Factor from which value sunshine is counted - the higher the later
    sunshine_min = 18     	# below this value (W/mÂ²), sunshine is not taken into account.
    sunshine_loop = 1      # use for sunshine loop packet (or archive: sunshine_loop = 0)
    rainDur_loop = 0       # use for rain duration loop packet - default is not       
    hailDur_loop = 0       # use for piezo-rain duration loop packet - default is not
    sunshine_log = 0       # should not be logged when sunshine is recorded
    rainDur_log = 0        # no logging for rain duration
    hailDur_log = 0        # no logging for piezo-rain duration
``` 

################################################# ###############################################

May 2025: 
Under [Accumulator] all "*.sig" removed, as not necessary

In sensors.inc the assignment of the signals (0..4) to percentage values ??(in the weewx.conf) is now automatically recognized and displayed correctly.

Only Ecowittcustom (former Interceptor): 

Jan 2024:
 - supports soilad1 - soilad16 and heap
 - If you will track the heap values - I use the unused value "pb" from the extended database for this

 So add this in the weeewx.conf file to
``` 
[StdCalibrate]
    [[Corrections]]
      pb = heap if heap is not None else None 
``` 

  
weewx-ecowittcustom.zip 
 - V4: sudo wee_extension --install=weewx-ecowittcustom.zip
 - V5: sudo weectl extension install weewx-ecowittcustom.zip

 or
 - V4: sudo wee_extension --install=/%path_where_file_located%/weewx-???.zip
to install.

Both use a new database schema:

wview_ecowitt.py

An existing database can also be expanded with these shell scripts:
  -> is very likely the easiest way

Version 5
- add_ecowitt_data_v5.sh
- add_ecowitt_allsignaldata_v5.sh

Version 4
- add_ecowitt_to_wview_database.sh
- add_ecowitt_to_wview_extended_database.sh

  The new data fields are added to the existing database and the old ones
  Data are retained.
  If you don't work with the standard configuration (/etc/weewx/weewx.conf), you have to
  adjust the --config=/etc/weewx/weewx.conf entry accordingly.

#################################################

In weewx.conf you can/should use the existing entry (only useful with a completely new installation) for 
``` 
Code:
[DataBindings]
     [[wx_binding]]
        schema = schemas.wview.schema
        schema_new = schemas.wview_ecowitt.schema # -> is entered in this way by the installation!
# Change to
        #schema = schemas.wview.schema
        schema = schemas.wview_ecowitt.schema

Possibly also the database name from weewx.sdb to weewx_ecowitt.sdb
to change.
Code:
[Databases]
     # A SQLite database is simply a single file
     [[archive_sqlite]]
         database_name = weewx.sdb
         database_type = SQLite
         database_name_new = weewx_ecowitt.sdb
         database_name_new = weewx_ecowittrssi.sdb
     change to
         # database_name = weewx.sdb
         database_type = SQLite
         database_name = weewx_ecowitt.sdb       # or database_name = weewx_ecowittrssi.sdb

Since the installation routine does not change any existing entries, one must in weewx.conf
adapt a few entries

Signal assignment with GW1000 driver (the Ecowittcustom driver can evaluate the signals with the foshkplugin )

But if you use FOSHKplugin, the interceptor can also evalute the signals and all
this other data (and more), which are only available via gw1000
The weewx-gw1000.zip installation routine adds these entries to weewx.conf:
